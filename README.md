2. Open it from your terminal or preferred CLI with `git clone <HTTPS or SSH key>`. 
3. Move (`cd`) into the directory. 
4. Open the file in your code editor of choice, and you'll have everything you need! 
5. The app can be viewed and interacted with in your browser of choice by using `open index.html` in your terminal.

### Server Installation Instructions:
1. Navigate to https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api
2. Clone the repo down to your preferred location (NOT within the main app repo)
3. Move (`cd`) into the directory on a separate terminal window from where you're running the front end

### Context:
This project was assigned during Week 5 of Module 2 in Turing's Front-End Engineering track. This was a solo project we were given 6 days to complete.  
### Contributors:
This application was built by: [Chris Butler](https://github.com/butlertree/)

### Learning Goals:
The goals of this project were to:
- utilize object and array prototype methods to manipulate data
- create a clear and user-friendly interface
- implement a robust testing suite via TDD
- make network requests to retrieve data
- prioritize DRY, reusable code

These were enacted on a MacBook Pro using GitHub, VS Code, Webpack, Google Chrome, the Mac Terminal, and Slack.

### Wins + Challenges:
### Wins:
- Confident use of javaScript with significant data manipulation.  
- Successfully refactored code to overcome challenges and match project rubric.
- Comfortable use of FETCH protocals. 
### Challenges:
- Figuring out how to efficiently connect all the separate local files and APIs.
- Becoming more comfortable with adding accessability framework into the UI.
